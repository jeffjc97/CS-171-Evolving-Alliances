		<h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
			<p>
					Large datasets on international relations are relatively rare, especially in writing for general audiences,
				rather than academic papers. Therefore, we thought it would be interesting to create an accessible way to engage
				with some of the existing quantitative IR data.
			</p>
			<p>
					In particular, one group member has an academic background and research interests in international relations
				and security, and used some of the Correlates of War data in their senior thesis. This led to an interest in
				creating an intuitive way to visually explore the data, rather than browsing through an enormous spreadsheet,
				or looking for particular relationships or effects with a statistics package.
			</p>
		<p>
			The core of our idea (overlaying a network of links on a map) came from this classâ€™ Lab 6 on visualizing
			airport connections. Additionally, the front page of the Correlates of War Project (http://www.correlatesofwar.org/)
			shows several map visualizations of some of their data, although these maps are not interactive, which limits the scope of the data they can show.
			We were also inspired by animated map visualizations that display data over time, such as the following:
			https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/islamic-state-attacks/. Recently, this type of visualization has
			been appearing fairly frequently in newspapers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times.

		</p>
		<h3>
			Objectives and Goals
		</h3>
		<p>
			Through this project, we hope to provide a straightforward, engaging means for people to interact with information
			on international relations. Specifically, our project will allow users to explore how relationships between
			different countries have changed over time - which countries have been allied, when, and for how long? Ideally,
			this will give users with an entry point into the world of quantitative data on international relations (a relatively new trend),
			and allow for intuitive exploration of data that might otherwise seem overwhelming, given its global scale and large time range.
